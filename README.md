A list of playbooks that I use to setup my home network environment.

note: 
- `main_server` is a group containing only one host, which is my Fedora server.
- `clients` is a group containing my Fedora Silverblue Desktop and my Fedora Asahi Macbook.
- The dnf5 module is used throughout, not the dnf module.
